先攻か後攻で決まるような
馬鹿げたペテン師のゲームに
実際踊らされて狂わされ
騙されたあげく
They want to make us pick a side
*
Damned if I do
It's way too late to fix it
I'll be damned if I don't
The bane of my existence
They said damn kid you gotta try
Even if you never win
You can't pretend
You'll never be happy again
Clip his wings he don't deserve that halo
I'm losing faith in everyone again
If the TV stations sell their lies on cable
Then we're so blind that we'll be tuning in
But I don't know where to start
*Repeat
Holding on to nothing
Til it turns into something
Don't like who I'm becoming
I can't keep running
Searching for an answer
Re-reading every chapter
There's no happy ever after when it's over
*Repeat
